# Digital Instrument Sound Reconstruction
The subject of the thesis was usage of one of the available sound synthesis methods to accurately reproduce the sound of a musical instrument, with emphasis on digital instruments like sound synthesizers.

The chosen method and its principle of operation was precisely described. Situations in which the system showed it’s superiority over classical additive synthesis were presented.

In the course of work, an app with graphical interface was made to ease testing phase and visualize the principle of algorithm’s operation. The app was written in Matlab version R2023a.
